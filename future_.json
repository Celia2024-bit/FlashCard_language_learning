          "Corrected": "We heard the new that Tom was fired and we were like \"What's the story with this?\" His boss spilled the details. He felt personally victimized by Tom's harsh words. Later Tom got real with his boss about his attitude and got/pick up a working hack --- repecting everyone in the office.",
          "Explain": "1. 词汇区别：bad words 特指“骂人的粗话、脏话”；harsh words 指“伤人的、刻薄的、严厉的言语”，此处老板因Tom的言语感到被冒犯，用 harsh words 更贴合语境（非粗话，而是伤人的话）；2. 核心口语表达对应 Module 1 具体卡片：① What's the story with this?（对应 Module 1 第9张）；② spilled the details（对应 Module 1 第7张）；③ got real with his boss（对应 Module 1 第10张）。",

So I got real with my parents about my thought :\"When my teacher talks science with jargon ,I am alway lost and can't get the real answer\".

          "Corrected": "I was playing video games with my friends when my parents suddenly put me on notice to finish my homework ,and I'm like, \"There is no end to homework\". I didn't listen to them and my parents totally felt triggered by my attitude . So I got real with my parents about how I felt :\"When my teacher talks science with jargon ,I am alway lost and can't get the real answer\".

          "Explain": "1. 词汇与表达优化：① \"my thought\" 过于正式，口语中用 \"how I felt\" 更自然；② \"told me his learning hack\" 中 \"told\" 仅表传递信息，用 \"shared\" 更体现分享经验；③ \"For really\" 改为 \"For real\"（口语正确表达）；2. 语法细节：\"my parent\" 改为复数 \"my parents\"；3. 核心表达对应 Module 1 知识点：triggered（第13张）、talk science with jargon（第6张）。",
