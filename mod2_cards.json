    "Corrected": "As we are inundated with jargons and often lost about the stuff we actually wander about, I'll be talking business without jargon. You know ,we haven't had a business talk in far way too long and it's hard to get real answers when everything sounds so complicated. And I'm like , \"Why not just keep it simple\"",
    "Explain": "1. keep it simple 是口语中常用表达，意为简单些，比\"make the stuff easier\"更自然；2. in way too long 是核心口语表达，in far way too long 是其强化形式，far 用于加强时隔太久的语气，符合日常对话习惯",

    "Corrected": "I haven't visited my parents in way too long. I was talking business when they suddenly shout, \"You should get married as soon as possible,\" and I'm like, \"What just happened? What are you even talking about?\" Inundated with pressure to get married, I decided to talk about the pros and cons of marriage without jargon and get some real answers. My parents were totally lost and felt personally victimized by stuff they never even cared about.",
    "Explain": "1. 时态/场景表达：\"What's happened?\" 侧重“近期已发生且有可见影响的事”，此处用 \"What just happened?\" 更贴合“突然发生”的即时场景，口语中也常用 \"What's going on?\" 表“当前情况”；2. 词汇替换：\"benefit and drawback\" 较书面，口语用 \"pros and cons\" 更自然，\"with jargon\" 逻辑相反，需改为 \"without jargon\"（无术语），\"wonder about\"（认知上好奇）需改为 \"care about\"（情感上在意），更符合“父母因不关心的事感到被冒犯”的语境；3. 语法细节：\"parent\" 需改为复数 \"parents\"，\"pressure of getting married\" 需调整为 \"pressure to get married\"（正确搭配）。",

Later Tom got real with his boss about his attitude and got/pick up a working hack --- repecting everyone in the office.",
    "Explain": "1. 词汇区别：bad words 特指“骂人的粗话、脏话”；harsh words 指“伤人的、刻薄的、严厉的言语”，此处老板因Tom的言语感到被冒犯，用 harsh words 更贴合语境（非粗话，而是伤人的话）；2. 核心口语表达对应 Module 1 具体卡片：① What's the story with this?（对应 Module 1 第9张）；② spilled the details（对应 Module 1 第7张）；③ got real with his boss（对应 Module 1 第10张）。",

    "Explain": "1. 词汇与表达优化：① \"my thought\" 过于正式，口语中用 \"how I felt\" 更自然；② \"told me his learning hack\" 中 \"told\" 仅表传递信息，用 \"shared\" 更体现分享经验；③ \"For really\" 改为 \"For real\"（口语正确表达）；2. 语法细节：\"my parent\" 改为复数 \"my parents\"；3. 核心表达对应 Module 1 知识点：triggered（第13张）、talk science with jargon（第6张）。",
